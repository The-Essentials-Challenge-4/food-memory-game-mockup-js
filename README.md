# Food Memory Game

A quick and dirty JavaScript implementation of a food memory game. The actual 
minimum viable product will be done in Swift for iOS, and the food items shown 
will be healthier food items, whereas in this quick and dirty mock-up we will 
just use whatever food items have corresponding emoji in the Unicode standard.
